  <summary>Episode 1</summary>


    
## The Caravan
You start as Rodinka and her traveling caravan, stopped in the road for a short rest. Rodinka expresses her desire to pee before they go.
Important things to do in this scene:

- Talk to Mari (facing the log), this will give you an item later in the episode.
- Talk to Lawrence (adds +1 relationship)
- To continue this scene, you must head south and encounter the H-Scene (peeing in bush)
    - The H-Scene can be skipped if you desire. You will fall down the cliff to enter the next scene.

Important notes for this scene:
- Reading the sign 46 times activates **Crazy Mode**. This changes Rodinka's short speeches into fourth wall breaks. This does not change the main content of the game very much.
- Lingering in this scene for too long will prompt Rodinka to wet herself, and end the game.

## The Forest
You have fallen down the cliff, and must get back to your caravan.

Important things to do in this scene: 

- Rodinka can wash herself in the nearby pond for a short H-Scene.
  - Avoid doing this if you want to see Nightmare 2 in Episode 2

As Rodinka continues to the right, there is a **Cedar Cone** (+1 LUCK) hidden in a patch of leaves.
- Patches of leaves usually indicate hidden items.

As Rodinka continues to the right, she will discover a small forest cabin. There is a **coin** hidden in the patch of leaves.

## The Witches House
Rodinka enters the Witches house. You can nearly interact with everything here.

Important things to do in this scene:

- Pick up the **dildo** in the box.
  - Interact with the box multiple times to take it.
- Pick up the **spell book** to start the "Little Squirrel Witch" quest.
- Pick up the **book** "Honey-bun from Zalseje, p.3" (this will help with money later)
  - Pick this up after grabbing the spellbook.

Continue out the back door of the Witches house, and go through the branches. This will (unfortunately) tear up your dress.

## The Road

Rodinka has made it back to the road, but the caravan is no where in sight. Continue right until you find the campfire.

Important things to do on the road:

- Interact with the campfire to receive a **Cat Pendant**
- Click the three bushes in order for explorer experience
- You can walk through the trees near the "3" bush to get **Inzhir's Dice** and get more explorer experience.

Once done, continue further right to enter next scene.

Rodinka will run into Farthew, the old man. You may now choose to ride with him, or continue walking down the road.

Important notes for this scene:

- Riding with Farthew will prompt H-Scenes
  - You need to pick this option if you want Nightmare 2 in Episode 2.
- If you continue walking, Rodinka will run into a group of boys traveling in the same direction.
  - You can find two more items on the road, and will have to "suck the poison out" for one of the boys. Further instructions below.

## The Boys (The Road)

Important things to do for this scene:

- Interact with the log for a **Golden Royal Bug**.
  - You can only collect this if you talked to Mari in the Caravan.
- Interact with the pile of leaves to collect **Mushrooms**.
