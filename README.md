# Episode 1
## The Caravan
You start as Rodinka and her traveling caravan, stopped in the road for a short rest. Rodinka expresses her desire to pee before they go.
Important things to do in this scene:

- Talk to Mari (facing the log), this will give you an item later in the episode.
- Talk to Lawrence (adds +1 relationship)
- To continue this scene, you must head south and encounter the H-Scene (peeing in bush)
    - The H-Scene can be skipped if you desire. You will fall down the cliff to enter the next scene.

Important notes for this scene:
- Reading the sign 46 times activates Crazy Mode. This changes Rodinka's short speeches into fourth wall breaks. This does not change the main content of the game very much.
- Lingering in this scene for too long will prompt Rodinka to wet herself, and end the game.

## The Forest
You have fallen down the cliff, and must get back to your caravan.

Important things to do in this scene:

- Rodinka can wash herself in the nearby pond for a short H-Scene.
  - Avoid doing this if you want to see Nightmare 2 in Episode 2

As Rodinka continues to the right, there is a Cedar Cone (+1 LUCK) hidden in a patch of leaves.
- Patches of leaves usually indicate hidden items.
